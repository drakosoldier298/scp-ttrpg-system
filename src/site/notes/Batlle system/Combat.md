Combat is something im very....concerned about makign as theres only one real way with ttrpg's to do it consistently. 

which is just to have people have a stat or roll for initiative and then have everyone have weapons with combat stats ect ect.
I dont know how to stray away so ill make some concepts for this style first before trying to make my own combat system



### Initiative.
Your initiative is based on rolling a d6 and then adding your energy stat

inititive determines the order of combat


### Energy
Energy is a fun little thing i need to work with

Your energy attribute isnt just another thing to roll with.

Energy determines the amount of actions you have, whether that be reloading, moving, dodging or attacking.  

When you run out of energy you will be unable to do *anything* for 4 turns.
Emergency actions, You have one, And it can only be used to negate a death per 5 rests.
