We will be runnning with the Character sheet for the  [[spitball/character creation/Character Sheets Alpha\|Character Sheets Alpha]] page

###  What is a check?
A check is well... a check, you have players do it when they want to do an action each check is associated with one or more stats, which we will call Attributes from now on or Attr for short.

### What are the attributes?

Currently the Character sheet has *a lot* 
I will be making a custom character sheet template eventually.

The Attr's i want to have are
Strength
Dexterity
Energy
Intelligence
Sanity

Then there are Skill Attrs i want to have which are
Combat prowess
Literacy
Communication
Persuasion
Creativity
Stealth
Conflict deconstruction: a more specific persuasion such as calming animals. children, ect ect.
### Examples
So lets run through examples of checks for these Attributes

Lets say theres a large book about engineering a player wants to read, 
Youd have them roll a d10 and then add literacy and Tech knowledge Or just intelligence.

Lets say theres a door that a player wants to brute force open, Roll a d10 and add Strength.

All attr's added are up to the Game master to decide, or the player to discuss. 
The only requirement is that you roll a d20 and then add whatever the number in your stat is.
