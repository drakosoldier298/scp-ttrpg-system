# **THEY ARE COSMETIC** 


Ok so to make a race sheet is to make players feel like they have to play them and since scp and things like it are based with multiverses and so many sentient and sapient creatures you could play as it'd be stupid to make players feel like they have to be certain races.

That and tying stats to them could make them unbalanced and unfun.
and very very time consuming.
