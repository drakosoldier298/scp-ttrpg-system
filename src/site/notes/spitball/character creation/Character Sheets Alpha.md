## How do they work?
Well I want the character sheets to be less stat based and more personality for example.
D&D uses a stat based system where you put points into strength charisma etc. etc. 

While that can be very good for an rgp where the goal is leveling and getting stronger, For an scp system i feel its be better to have character sheets be more about personality, allows the Game master to tweak campaigns to be horrifying to characters and make them difficult or fun within the scope of characters.

This does not mean there aren't stats for you to level up.

# Actual explanation

### Core attributes.
These are attributes that you gain upon character creation **These rarely change**

### Skill attributes. 
These will level up as you progress and do things with them

I feel everything else is self explanatory
