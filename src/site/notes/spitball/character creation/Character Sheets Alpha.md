## How do they work?
Well I want the character sheets to be less stat based and more personality for example.
D&D uses a stat based system where you put points into strength charisma etc. etc. 

While that can be very good for an rgp where the goal is leveling and getting stronger, For an scp system i feel its be better to have character sheets be more about personality, allows the Game master to tweak campaigns to be horrifying to characters and make them difficult or fun within the scope of characters.

This does not mean there arent stats for you to level up.
