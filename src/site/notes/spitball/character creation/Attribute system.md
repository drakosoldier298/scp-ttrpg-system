The Attr's i want to have are
Strength - Used for well...strength checks
Dexterity - used for dex checks, say someone has to jump over something or slide/crawl under something.

Energy - How many actions a player can take in one turn of combat before being out of the battle, If you do not expend all energy it refreshes at half + what you had left over next turn.

Intelligence - hacking, tech literacy, literacy.

Sanity - This attribute determines how many situations that can raise anxiety stat / lower sanity before you start gaining anxiety


Then there are Skill Attr's i want to have which are
Combat prowess
Literacy
Communication
Persuasion
Creativity
Stealth
Conflict deconstruction: a more specific persuasion such as calming animals. children, ect ect.


## Well how Do i decide what attributes my character has? 

the base for everything will be 5 which is a +0 and the max is 10

Roll a d10 for each attribute. 10 is +5
1 is -4

 if you have a 1 you can make it a zero to make a 9 a 10


## How do attributes affect Gameplay

They mostly are used for the [[spitball/Check system/Check System Alpha\|Check System Alpha]]

#### What if I have a +5?
 a +5 or max roll is not a guaranteed success Those do not exist in this system.
