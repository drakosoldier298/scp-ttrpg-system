The Attr's i want to have are
Strength
Dexterity
Energy
Intelligence
Sanity
Anxiety

Then there are Skill Attr's i want to have which are
Combat prowess
Literacy
Communication
Persuasion
Creativity
Stealth
Conflict deconstruction: a more specific persuasion such as calming animals. children, ect ect.


## Well how Do i decide what attributes my character has? 

the base for everything will be 5 which is a +0 and the max is 10

Roll a d10 for each attribute. 10 is +5
1 is -4

 if you have a 1 you can make it a zero to make a 9 a 10


## How do attributes affect Gameplay

They mostly are used for the [[spitball/Check system/Check System Alpha\|Check System Alpha]]

#### What if I have a +5?
 a +5 or max roll is not a guaranteed success Those do not exist in this system.
