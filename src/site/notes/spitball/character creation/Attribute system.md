The Attr's i want to have are

Strength - Used for well...strength checks

Dexterity - used for dex checks, say someone has to jump over something or slide/crawl under something.

Energy - How many actions a player can take in one turn of combat before being out of the battle For a few turns, If you do not expend all energy it refreshes at half + what you had left over next turn.

Communication -  Allows you to passively obtain more information than others would. 

Intelligence - hacking, tech literacy, literacy.

Sanity - This attribute determines how many situations that can raise anxiety stat / lower sanity  You can ignore before you start gaining anxiety, Restore on long rests.

Then there are Skill Attr's i want to have which are
Combat prowess - Use of guns and other advanced weaponry, 
 - Also gives more energy in specifically combat scenerios +1 per 2 combat
 
Literacy - Reading and hacking.

Persuasion - Similiar to communication, Allows you to actively gain more information when talking to people/entities.

Creativity - crafting.

Stealth- sneaking around enemies, Dex stat

Conflict deconstruction: a more specific persuasion such as calming animals. children, sapient scp's ect ect.


## Well how Do i decide what attributes my character has? 

the base for everything will be 5 which is a +0 and the max is 10

Roll a d10 for each attribute. 10 is +5
1 is -4

 if you have a 1 you can make it a zero to make a 9 a 10

Zero gives permanent disadvantage, meaning you roll twice and take the lower then add -5 ontop of it.


## How do attributes affect Gameplay

They mostly are used for the [[spitball/Check system/Check System Alpha\|Check System Alpha]]

#### What if I have a +5?
 a +5 or max roll(10) is not a guaranteed success Those do not and will not ever exist in this system.
