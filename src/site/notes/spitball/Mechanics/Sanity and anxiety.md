The anxiety stat is a stat that raises when the character is in distress, such as being near an scp, a certain player or npc, or in the dark.

 - Holding a weapon the player has knowledge in, IE the character is an ex gaurd and has a handgun, they will feel a bit less anxious as theyre holdign it, This does not consistantly drop anxiety levels.
-  Being in groups. The more the party splits the harder losing anxiety is.
