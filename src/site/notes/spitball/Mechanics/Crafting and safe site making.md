oh god this is gonna be a fun one.
Goals
- [ ] A semi robust crafting system with examples of what works with what
- [x] a simple inventory system
- [x] Determine what objects could give what materials
- [x] what materials can be used to make what things
- [x] what things are not craftable
- [ ] what skill/attribute is associated with crafting.
- [ ] How different amounts of said skill interact.\

## Inventory
 Lets tackle what should be the simplest thing, 

Inventory. Something usually ignored in ttrpg is weight, I want to find an alternative to weight that can be done on paper. 

The idea i really want is just to have a tileable inventory where each item fits into a grid however this just *doesnt* work for paper and pen players.

We will be using a weight system for now.
Weight will be done in units so you cant ask "HOW CAN HAVE THIS MUCH POUNDS/KILOGRAMS"


The max a player can hold will be 150 Units For now 

| Item name | Weight   | Value | STR |
| --------- | -------- | ----- | --- |
| Board     | 5 Units  | 2$    | ≤5  |
| Table Leg | 5 units  | 5$    | ≤5  |
| Desk      | 50 units | 20$   | 8   |
|           |          |       |     |

## Crafting
This system is actually pulled from a homebrew dnd system i use constantly. 
Mending, allowing you to take 2 objects and mend/meld them together into a new one.

For our purposes this is a crafting system, and instead of magic you need duct tape or nails, some kind of adhesive.

Depending on your Creativity stat depends on how much durability and usccess making a weapon has.

### How does it work
Players will be able to obtain items from breaking down objects, finding them around, or buying them from npc's

They can then spend time in safepoints to cobble together new items. 
Roll a d20 and add Creativity stat 
Beat a 15 for most basic items

Say the players broke down a desk and grabbed one of its legs, that is now a weapon, but they want more damage, shove nails into or duct tape a knife to it. Now you have a stronger weapon.

Or they have couch cushions and no armor, tape it in a way that the cushion can be worn for small bit of protection.

### What can be crafted

As mentioned before it can be alot so ill only be giving examples in the table below.


| Input     | Input | Method | Output                                              |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Table Leg |       | Nails  | Spiked Table leg(gains extra damage)                |
| Table Leg | Knife | Tape   | Bayonetted Table Leg (gains extra reach and damage) |
|           |       |        |                                                     |
### What can't be crafted
Things that would require intricate knowledge 

Examples
Guns, like *any* gun, 
Flashights
most electronics.
Swords

## Safepoints

This is a very...interesting system to write since they can be player made as well.


Safe points can be many things, from a guard checkpoint to a barricaded room. 

What's important is that their are no enemies around. And a light source

Players also can make them 

#### How can my players make their own safepoints and why?

So the ability to make safepoints, This is being implemented because many Dungeon masters forget to add a place to actually allow resting between combat encounters and due to the [[spitball/Mechanics/Sanity and anxiety\|Sanity and anxiety]] mechanic safe points are required. 

##### How can players make a safe point ?
As mentioned earlier safepoints can be barricaded rooms SO all players need to do is gather nails or just move desks, tables and other things in front of doors to make it harder for things to get in and make sure theirs a light source in the camp.
